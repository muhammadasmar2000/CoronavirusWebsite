--Executive Summary--
The final product of this project will be an informative news-website focused on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The website will use two main APIs. One will be a coronavirus API for raw data, the other will be a news API which will filter for articles mentioning the pandemic across multiple sources. Each article will have a related discussion forum in which users can comment their thoughts on the article. Due to normal new sources having a focus in a variety of areas, it can sometimes be hard to find up-to-date information on the pandemic specifically. The main advantage of this website is it will compile all these articles into one place. Additionally, the private forum will allow users to express their thoughts and feel connected.

-What can go wrong: In the case where the passwords do not match, the user will be prompted to type both passwords again.

Use Cases (stories):
-Seeking Up-to-date Information:
A business-owner, Jill, is seeking up-to-date information on pandemic so she can plan her next move accordingly. She is only interested in news regarding the pandemic, but many news sites include many articles that are irrelevant to her interest. After searching for a bit, she stumbles across this website. She sees that the website not only has constantly updated statistics regarding the pandemic, but also has related news articles from a variety of sources. Additionally, she finds it interesting that there are discussion posts seperate from the articles, where people share their thoughts on the situation. Jill decides to make an account so she can comment on the articles as well.




--Initial list of high-level function requirements--
Discussion Board/Comment Section: Beneath each article, there will be a comment section related to the article. If the user is logged in, they have the option to make a new comment or reply to someone else's. The comments are ordered from most to least recent.

Account Creation: The user has the option to create an account in order to make comments on articles. Username is visible to others when they make a comment.

Pandemic data: Appears either at the top of the page or on the sides. It is always visible regardless of how far the user scrolls.
